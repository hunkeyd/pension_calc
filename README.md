# pension_calc_2021

This project was a weekend study of military retirement pays in 2021.  The goal was
to have a generic understanding of the annual value of a military pension. It was 
designed for Marines (as it sources calculations from the Marine Corps Order on 
Seperations) but should theoretically apply to all services.

This calculator will give a general estimate of retired military pay for each grade 
based on the service members time in service. The calculator assumes that you'll 
spend the last three years of service at the same rank.  If you're promoted in those 
last three years, you'll recieve a pension somewhere between the two ranks served.
I recommend using this calculator to understand ballpark what a military pension is 
worth annually.
